# Tristan Wede Lind

Fifth assignment

## Task

Create a responsive single page application (SPA) for the fictive web developer, author and public speaker Tristan Wede Lind.

The page should behave as in the attached pictures. However, feel free to implement responsiveness the way you think best and to use the colour palette and typography of your choice.


## Note:
The img files were to large to push to GitHub. Locally i have them in a folder titled img
